# Available Settings
- `config`: The configuration on which a command is to work on (string) (env: `WS_CONFIG`)
- `configs`: The configurations on which a command is to work on, with the additional option of `"all"` (list of strings) (env: `WS_CONFIGS`, comma seperated)
	- Defaults to the value of `config`
- `default-linker`: The default linker (string) (env: `WS_DEFAULT_LINKER`)
- `jobs`: The maximum number of jobs to run in parallel (int) (env: `WS_JOBS`)
- `recipes`: The set of recipes a command is to work on, with the additional option of `"all"` (list of strings) (env: `WS_RECIPES`, comma seperated)
- `reference-repositories`: The location of the reference repositories (string) (env: `WS_REFERENCE_REPOSITORIES`)
	- Running a command that tries to check out a repository while this is not set (the default) will prompt the user with an appropriate default value, that is then stored in the settings file
- `uri-schemes`: The configured extra URI schemas (dictionary of strings to strings)
	- The default settings provide the schemes `github://` and `laboratory://`, both of which resolve to the `ssh` version of their respective destinations
	- There is no way to set this setting to any sensible value outside of the settings file.
- `shell`: The shell that is used by the `shell` command (one of `"auto"`, `"bash"`, `"fish"`, `"zsh"`) (env: `WS_SHELL`)
	- This operation does *not* currently change the shell that is actually started by the command, but rather only overrides the detection
- `X-git-clone`: Additional arguments to pass to the underlying git clone call (list of strings) (env: `WS_X_GIT_CLONE`, space separated)
